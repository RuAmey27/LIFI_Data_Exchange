# LIFI Data Exchange System

![LIFI Data Exchange System](images/lifi_system.jpg)

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for our first-year engineering exploration lab project, the LIFI Data Exchange System. LIFI, which stands for Light Fidelity, is a wireless communication technology that uses visible light to transmit data. Our system consists of two modules: a transmitter and a receiver, which can exchange data using light waves.

## Features

- Data transmission using light waves (LIFI) for wireless communication.
- Electrically isolated circuits for improved safety and reliability.
- Microcontroller-based design for efficient data handling.
- LED display on the receiver module to showcase received data.

## Components Used

- Microcontroller: [Arduino Mega 2560]
- LCD Display: [LCD 16Ã—2]
- Light Sensor: [Small LED light, LDR Sensor]
- Keypad: [4*4 keypad matrix]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Microcontroller C++]( https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) installed on your development environment.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lifi-data-exchange.git
cd lifi-data-exchange
```

2. Connect the transmitter and receiver modules as per the circuit diagram provided.

3. Program the microcontrollers using Microcontroller C with the provided code in the respective directories.

4. Power up the transmitter and receiver modules and ensure they are within the line of sight for successful data transmission.

## Usage

1. Enter the data on the transmitter module.

2. The transmitter will convert the data into light wave signals.

3. The receiver module will capture the light wave signals using the light sensor.

4. The received data will be displayed on the LED display.
